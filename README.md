===== COMPILE =====

Just type make in the folder ./

===== NOTE =====

Pre-trained embeddings for entity/relation/word are optional.
We update both Structure-based Representations and Description-based Representations in this version. We can also fix Structure-based Representations pre-trained by other models and only update Description-based Representations.

===== CITE =====

If you use the code, you should cite the following paper:
